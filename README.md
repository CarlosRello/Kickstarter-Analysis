# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
We ran 2 main analysis to assess the probability of launching a successful campaign for a play
On our first analysis we considered the outcomes based on the launching month of the campaign considering years from 2009 through 2017 and on raw data we can observe that theater campaigns that are launched in May has a bigger successful rate than other months

On our second Analysis we considered the outcome probability of success of a campaign based on how much money is being asked, we observe that when a smaller amount than 5000 is asked the probability of getting funded remains above 70%, and this success rate drops dramatically above that threshold up to 30,000 that remains fairly constant with a near 50% success rate.

## We consider the following questions
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
As stated May seems to be a good month to launch a theater campaign who need some funding and December seems to be the worst month to do so, that could have a relationship between that theater openings are always bigger and more successful in the December, so launching a campaign on those months might have a better an opening than it would if the opening is in the middle of the year, people go to the theater more on the last months of the year on that time having a bigger probability of a successful opening.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We observe from the Analysis of the Outcomes based on Goals that when a smaller amount of money is asked (up to 5,000) for the project the probability of getting funded is bigger, probably because the goal is reached faster and not so many pledges are required to achieve the goal, although, we also observe that with bigger goal amounts up to 45,000 the success percentage remains fairly stable between 40 and 50%, and drops dramatically over that amount, which could be also because more pledges are required and the goal is not reached fast enough.
### What are some limitations of this dataset?

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
